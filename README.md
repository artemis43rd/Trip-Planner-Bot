### Visited

A point can be marked as visited in two ways: manually and using geolocation.

In order to mark a point manually, you need to use the command **/set_visited_state.** Usage example: /set_visited_state "Trip Name" "Point Name" "Date".

In order to mark a point through geolocation, it is enough for the bot to drop its geolocation. The bot checks whether the point matches the name of the point in the trip with the In-Progress status.  If yes, then the bot will mark the point as visited, if not, it will offer to use the command.

A trip gets a status In-Progress when the time of its starting point falls at the current moment.

## Reminder

The bot has a 24-hour trip reminder function. The check is carried out once every 12 hours. 

During the check, the bot checks if there is a point with such a time, which will start in less than a day. If there is such a point, then the bot sends a reminder and a countdown.
